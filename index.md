## 🧠 Project Overview

This project combines **speech recognition**, **natural language understanding**, **vector-based document retrieval**, and **real-time AI streaming** to create a smart, scalable assistant.

The assistant uses:

- 🗣️ Voice + text input/output via a custom ChatGPT-style UI
- 🤖 FastAPI backend with WebSocket support
- 🧾 LangChain + ChromaDB for document embedding and semantic search
- ✨ GPT-3.5 Turbo (OpenAI) for fast, reliable, and context-aware response generation
- 🧠 SQLite database for user authentication and chat history logging

## ✨ Key Features

✅ Voice + text interaction  
✅ Real-time streaming AI responses  
✅ Document ingestion with vector-based querying  
✅ Fast and scalable FastAPI backend  
✅ User login/signup system  
✅ Chat history stored in SQLite  
✅ Clean, responsive UI using custom `chat.html`
