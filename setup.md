### 🔹 Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rhytham16/TMU-interns-ai-voice-agent.git
cd TMU-interns-ai-voice-agent
```
### 🔹 Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash

### 🔹 Step 3: Install All Required Dependencies

This project requires several Python packages for FastAPI, LangChain, ChromaDB, OpenAI, and more.

Run the following:
```bash
uv sync --link-mode=copy
```
Or manually, you can install core dependencies:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn langchain openai chromadb \
python-dotenv pydantic aiofiles requests PyPDF2 \
langchain-openai langchain-core langchain-community \
langchain-text-splitters websockets SQLAlchemy \
coloredlogs humanfriendly langchain_chroma pypdf
```

### 🔹 Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file at the project root and add your GPT API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 🔹 Step 5: Set Up the SQLite Database

```bash
python setup_db.py
```
### 🔹 Step 6: Load PDFs (Document Embedding)
Make sure your PDF is placed in one of the following locations:

```bash
./
./data/
./documents/
```
Then run:

```
python load_documents.py
```

### 🔹 Step 7: Run the FastAPI App

Start the server:

```bash
python app.py 
```
Or
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Visit the app in your browser:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

You can now:
- Sign up and log in
- Ask questions from your uploaded documents
- Chat in real time via WebSocket (/ws/{session_id})
